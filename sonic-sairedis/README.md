# SONiC - SAI Redis - sairedis

## Description
The SAI Redis provides a SAI redis service that built on top of redis database. It contains two major components, 1) a SAI library
that puts SAI objects into the redis database, 2) a syncd that takes the SAI objects and puts them into the ASIC.

## Getting Started

### Install

Before installing, add key and package sources:

    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver apt-mo.trafficmanager.net --recv-keys 417A0893
    echo 'deb http://apt-mo.trafficmanager.net/repos/sonic/ trusty main' | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sonic.list
    sudo apt-get update

Install dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install redis-server -t trusty
    sudo apt-get install libhiredis0.13 -t trusty
    
Install building dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install libtool
    sudo apt-get install autoconf automake
    sudo apt-get install dh-exec

There are a few different ways you can install sairedis.

#### Install from Debian Repo

For your convenience, you can install prepared packages on Debian Jessie:

    sudo apt-get install libsairedis syncd

#### Install from Source

Checkout the source: `git clone https://github.com/Azure/sonic-sairedis.git` and install it yourself.

Get SAI header files into /usr/include/sai. Put the SAI header files that you use to compile
libsairedis into /usr/include/sai

Get ASIC SDK and SAI packages from your ASIC vendor and install them.

Install prerequisite packages:

    sudo apt-get install libswsscommon libswsscommon-dev

You can compile and install from source using:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make && sudo make install

You can also build a debian package using:

    ./autogen.sh
    fakeroot debian/rules binary

### GitHub Workflow

We're following basic GitHub Flow. If you have no idea what we're talking about, check out [GitHub's official guide](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). Note that merge is only performed by the repository maintainer.

Guide for performing commits:

* Isolate each commit to one component/bugfix/issue/feature
* Use a standard commit message format:

>     [component/folder touched]: Description intent of your changes
>
>     [List of changes]
>
> 	  Signed-off-by: Your Name your@email.com

For example:

>     swss-common: Stabilize the ConsumerTable
>
>     * Fixing autoreconf
>     * Fixing unit-tests by adding checkers and initialize the DB before start
>     * Adding the ability to select from multiple channels
>     * Health-Monitor - The idea of the patch is that if something went wrong with the notification channel,
>       we will have the option to know about it (Query the LLEN table length).
>
>       Signed-off-by: user@dev.null
